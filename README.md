#Gamifying Eco-Friendly Transportation

Problem STatement - 
Urban areas face challenges like traffic congestion, air pollution, and carbon emissions due to increased private vehicle usage. To promote eco-friendly transportation options (walking, biking, carpooling, public transit), we need an innovative mobile app that uses gamification and social elements to motivate users, reduce private car dependence, and create sustainable cities. Daily challenges, leaderboards, and a supportive community foster engagement, while real-time incentives, optimized route planning, and carbon footprint tracking enhance the experience and environmental impact awareness. With an intuitive interface and seamless integration, the application must revolutionize urban commuting habits for greener, healthier, and vibrant spaces.
